## Project Description 
TripEase is a web application tailored for individuals at all levels of travel experience to streamline the process of planning any trip. The sign-up process will guide users through the journey planning process, simplifying tasks from selecting departure and destination points to finalizing itineraries within an intuitive web interface. For budget-conscious travelers, TripEase will locate convenient and cost-effective gas stops, along with their information, along their route. The application will also inform users about unpredictable weather conditions through real-time weather updates, a weather overlay, and a weather radar for up to seven days in advance.
   
TripEase's integration with various APIs guarantees a seamless flow of current information, encompassing weather updates and gas prices. This comprehensive integration will enhance the efficiency of the web application, ensuring users have accurate and up-to-date insights for a more streamlined trip-planning experience.
